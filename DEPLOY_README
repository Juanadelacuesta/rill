Requirements:

  gem install capistrano appsignal

Deploy:

  sh deploy.sh <env production or staging> <full sha you want to deploy>

Capistrano finds the jar and zips for the sha from s3, that are put there after a succesfull build on the ci

Check version that is deployed:

  cap <env production or staging> version

Servers to deploy to are defined in config/<env>.rb if you comment out some servers you can deploy to a single server if needed. Do not comment out the load-balancer, only any of the four sf<env>learning/sf<env>login/sf<env>school/sf<env>teaching

10 last jars are kept on servers, therefor rollback should be quick

Of a cold deploy edit deploy.sh and change the cap line to:

   cap $1 deploy:cold -s revision=$2

Add my ip to kibana dashboard:

  sudo ufw allow from <ip> on sfprodbalancer

Also nice:

Do not forget to tag the version you just deployed (and push your tags)!
