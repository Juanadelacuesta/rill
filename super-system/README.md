# Running super-system

The super-system is the development system that runs multiple systems
in the same JVM while possible sharing components.


# How to run

Run ```make``` in this directory, start the REPL, run ```(go)``` and
point your browser to http://localhost:3000/.  Now you should be able
to login with email address ```dev-student-one@studyflow.nl``` and
password ```student```.


# During development

When using cider, compilation of namespaces should work.
