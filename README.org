#+TITLE: Rill Event Sourcing Toolkit
#+CAPTION: Build status
[[https://travis-ci.org/rill-event-sourcing/rill.svg]]

A Clojure foundation for CQRS/Event Sourcing.

* This is an alpha release.

  We are using Rill in production but things are still in flux. Breaking
  changes to the API are likely, though we have every intention of
  making upgrades straightforward.

  Documentation is missing for almost everything.

* Dependency specification

** Changed group-id and artifact-ids

   Please note that we changed group-id and artifact-ids for the 0.2.0
   release, where we also split up the old rill/rill artifact into its
   separate components.

   #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  [rill-event-sourcing/rill.event_store "0.2.0"] ; if you're talking to the bare event-store
  [rill-event-sourcing/rill.handler "0.2.0"] ; pulls in the write side of CQRS
  [rill-event-sourcing/rill.event_store.memory "0.2.0"] ; for development
  [rill-event-sourcing/rill.temp_store "0.2.0"] ; for testing
  [rill-event-sourcing/rill.event_store.psql "0.2.0"] ; to include postgres backend
  [rill-event-sourcing/rill.event_channel "0.2.0"] ; for hooking up asynchronous read side
   #+END_SRC

* Rill provides protocols and/or implementations for:

** EventStore

   The *system of record* in an Event Sourcing architecture; a
   collection of event streams with provisions for appending and
   retrieving events.

   Rill provides two complete implementations of the EventStore
   protocol; an ephemeral, in-memory store for testing/development,
   and a durable implementation using Postgresql as a backing store.

** Repository

   Aggregate storage implemented on top of an EventStore. Aggregates
   are implemented as reductions of event streams.

** Command handler

   Rill implements a fairly simple command -> repository -> aggregate
   -> events loop for evaluating commands and storing the resulting
   events in the event store. Synchronous event triggers are
   implemented with the provisional *observers* hook.

** Messages; commands and events

   Rill provides mechanisms for defining message schemas and hooks for
   integrating messages with the command handler, event store and
   repository.

** Event Channels

   Event channels are core/async channels that provide "real time"
   views on event streams.
